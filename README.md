# AWS-Cloud-Practitioner-Cert

This repository contains ANKI flashcards deck, that I have assembled when preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. It is based on the freely available deck that can be found here - https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1469596231 - but I have extended it with lots of additional material. Right now it contains over 300 cards.
